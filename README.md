## 🧮 Algorithm Choices

### Quality Score Formula
```
Quality Score = (Points × 0.4) + (Comments × 0.3) + (Recency × 0.3)
```

### Why This Formula Makes Sense

**Points Component (40% weight)**
- **Rationale**: Points are the most direct measure of community value and interest
- **Implementation**: Capped at 40 to prevent viral outliers from dominating rankings
- **Why 40%**: High enough to reward quality content, but balanced with other factors

**Comments Component (30% weight)**
- **Rationale**: Comments indicate engagement and discussion value
- **Implementation**: Logarithmic scaling `log10(comments + 1) × 10` prevents spam inflation
- **Why 30%**: Significant but not overwhelming - encourages discussion without gaming

**Recency Component (30% weight)**
- **Rationale**: Fresh content deserves visibility in a fast-moving news environment
- **Implementation**: Exponential decay with 24-hour half-life `30 × (0.5^(hours/24))`
- **Why 30%**: Balances fresh content with quality - prevents old viral posts from dominating

**Quality Labels**
- **Excellent** (80+): Must-read content with high engagement
- **Very Good** (60-79): Strong community interest
- **Good** (40-59): Worth reading
- **Fair** (20-39): Moderate interest  
- **Poor** (<20): Lower priority content

### Advanced Filtering System

**Sort Options**
- **By Points**: Sort stories by upvote count (highest/lowest)
- **By Comments**: Sort stories by comment count (most/least discussion)
- **By Time**: Sort stories by recency (newest/oldest)

**Implementation**
- **Professional UI**: Clean dropdown interface in the navigation bar
- **URL Parameters**: Sort preferences persist in browser history
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant sorting without page refresh
- **Mobile Responsive**: Compact design that works on all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
